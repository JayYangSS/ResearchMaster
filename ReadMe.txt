This is the readme file.

Most of the projects are used and implemented for my master thesis.
Thanks to the OpenCV community and their contribution to these open source libraries.

My master thesis can be found from:

If you can any questions, please send email to tzuo041@uottawa.ca, I will try my best to reply to you at the earlist time.
Any comments and questions are welcomed.

Thank you. :)
